The picture can not capture the spectacular psychedelic look and feel of these. It pops right out at you and there is so much depth. Numbered from an edition of 500. Comes unframed, in mint condition! This art piece is a feast for the eye and takes many visits to explore everything in the artwork. The artist does hide names and objects in his art, so you have to look closely! The artist, Ben G, works mainly in black ink with Rapidograph pens. The image is indented into the paper. Using a raised surface printing plate or type resulting in a \u201cbite\u201d into the paper\u2019s surface. Printed by an expert on 100% cotton 300gsm Crane Lettra paper on a 100 year old Heidelberg printing press.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":218,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"product-detail.php","product-category":[18],"blocksy_meta":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/elementor-templates\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/jl-product\/88"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/elementor-templates\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/jl-product"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/elementor-templates\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/jl-product"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/elementor-templates\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/218"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/elementor-templates\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=88"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"product-category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/elementor-templates\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product-category?post=88"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
